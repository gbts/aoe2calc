# AoE2 stats calculator

This is the source code for a AoE2Calc, a web-based AoC unit stats calculator. All the data is
compiled from the original dat files with [genieutils](https://github.com/Tapsa/genieutils).
The final stats are all computed in the browser so there's no need for a backend.

The source is in Elm, except for the dat import script (not currently in this repo).

Suggestions/issues/PRs are welcome.
